Module for OCDLA to display and interact with a Google map.

This project is a Google map I developed for the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association as a Full-Stack Developer Intern. This map feature is styled using OCDLA colors and themes. Using SOQL to fetch member data and geocodes from Salesforce. I created custom marker icons that are used to display multiple layers of data to the user. These different layers of data include locations of current OCDLA members and circuit court locations in Oregon.
